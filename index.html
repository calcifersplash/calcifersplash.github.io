        <p class="info"> One of the most famous landmarks in Linarria is The Linua Tower which has been carefully restored by the Linarrian Landmark Society in 1999 after a fire spread to the base. There are a variety of museums and art galleries, showcasing our most prized works - the most known one is probably the <strong> Mona Lisa by Leonardo DaVinci</strong>. He was inspired by the Linarrain women who worked very hard in the fields across the island so therefore invited Luia into his mansion to paint her. His mansion which he left to his good friend, Puerto, who lived on the island, is also a very popular landmark.  </p>
